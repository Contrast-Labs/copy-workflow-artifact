Github provides actions/download-artifact, which allows jobs to access artifacts generated by other jobs in the same workflow.

This action does something different: it copies an artifact from a target workflow to ~this~ workflow. This allows jobs in ~this~ workflow to use artifacts generated by another workflow.
